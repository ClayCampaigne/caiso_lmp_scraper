# caiso_lmp_scraper
Author: Clay Campaigne

A python 3.6+ module for scraping LMPs from the CAISO OASIS web API. Written by Clay C, starting from a script written
by Max Balandat, and also drawing some inspiration from a notebook of Alex Woolf of Lineage Logistics.
Note that the CAISO OASIS API doesn't retain data more than 39 months old, as of late 2017.
